I'm Adolfo Ram√≠rez Corona, UX, media and content consultant.

I'm an author, Informatics Engineer, Psychotherapist, and Philosopher, [among other things](https://adolforismos.github.io/markdown-cv/).

This is my site for notes that don't fit in the different kind of content I publish in [Medium](https://medium.com/@adolforismos), [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/), [Concepts Against Reality](https://adolforismos.substack.com/), books, or other content in [Spanish](https://adolforismos.com).

Most of these notes are working notes.
