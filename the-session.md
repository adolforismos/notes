### The session

The space and time where and when psychotherapy (or any kind of mental treatment) happens and it’s experienced receive the name of “session”.

In every therapeutic session, the therapist and patient try to get “into the zone”. Call it “entering a state of mental flow”, trance or area of trust. Freud named it “oceanic feeling”. It’s a state in which you are open to learning new things. When the body and mind are open to new experiences, learning, to reconnect, to transform.

The state that we try to achieve in each session is a natural state. This means that it is a state or an experience that we have several times a day. Well, in an ideal scenario.

For example, when you are resting, with a lost mind, looking at the horizon. When you are listening to music, paying attention to a teacher, or enchanted with your partner’s eyes.

Sessions are _Enacted experiences_ in a _Enabling enviroment_.
