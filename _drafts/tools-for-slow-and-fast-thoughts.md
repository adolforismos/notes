title: Tools for slow and fast thoughts

---
When my train of thought goes too fast about a project, about a new study, or when I suffer from information overload about a topic, I need to slow down or have a pause.

A change of tool for thought is useful in these cases: stop typing ideas on the computer and start handwriting them on paper.

We tend to over appreciate the tools for thought that help us to think fast. But sometimes we need to think slower. 

Math calculations on a spreadsheet or in Python can help you to process complex formulas to go forward for more. But as my high school teacher said, using a calculator to resolve problems is useless if we don't understand what the calculator is doing.

Tools for slow thoughts are under-appreciated, but they have a special value in helping us to live the full experience of thinking.
