title: The sacred power of sessions

---
One of the most important things I’ve learned as a psychotherapist is the use of sessions. It’s a concept to think about. But most of all, it’s a concept to work with.

A session is a space and time where you set a work protocol with the goal to protect and feed analysis, creativity, and flow.

The only way to promote creative freedom, an open mind, and a measurable outcome, is to have some boundaries or constraints. Creativity needs chaos but in an environment of order.

I can’t follow the trending advice of writing on your smartphone while commuting or writing some words while waiting in the doctor's office.

I take notes, ideas, phrases, everywhere, but for writing, I need to set a session, a specific place, and time.

I prefer to limit myself to the temptation to stand up and go to the freezer for a snack, so I like to write in coffee shops. But even when I write at home or in an office, I try to have with me everything I’m going to need, use, drink or eat, on the table or desk, set a timer or consider an hour to finish, and start writing without stand up from my chair or seat.

And writing means writing, no social networks, no news, no phone, no email. Just writing. I use the browser in the computer to check for my previous research or do a quick one, to consult the dictionary or Wikipedia for detail, but if that is going to take me more than a minute, I just write an ‘XXX’ or ‘TK’ to check it later.

You can have sessions for writing as for proofreading or editing. But the trick is that \[\[The session\]\]s always have something sacred, which means that you have to give them the importance they deserve, trait them with respect, and appreciate them.
