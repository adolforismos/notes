title: Intermittent and pure flow in the creative process

---
There are two kinds of flows during the creative process. A pure flow and intermittent flow.

A pure flow is a freewriting, automatic writing. No need to explain. But it is a flow that can be boring. You donâ€™t have to pay much attention. You are a witness to the process.

An intermittent flow is more like when I design. I must do or solve little tasks in a little amount of time each. I have a general vision of what I want but I must develop little tasks to do it. Every task is a little challenging. That takes the boredom away and generates engagement.

This is important because I can distinguish to separate parts of the process. This is the place for ideas and freewriting. The text editor or the typewriter are the places for writing sentences, phrases, like lego pieces, like design elements.

Another way to view it is the difference between painters and designers.

Painters as in Pollock. And designers as architects.

Arbitrary division of course, just for didactic proposes.

For painters, creativity is pure flow. In designers the creativity is intermittent.

But the combination of both is important for the complete creative process. Writing, for example, is a process in these two phases. You write without thinking in editing (pure flow), and then you edit (intermittent flow).

Or, when I write ideas or use writing as thinking, the flow is pure. But when I write for an article or a manual, I experience intermittent flow thinking in the structure, the possible responses, the references, etc.
