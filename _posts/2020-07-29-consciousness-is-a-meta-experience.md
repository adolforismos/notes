title: Consciousness is a meta experience

---
Consciousness can be defined as self-awareness or awareness of awareness. But you can say that consciousness is the experience of experience.

We have made consciousness a rational thing, but reason can be part of the experience of experience. Sometimes it can be the main element in the experience. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t have experience of the experience from emotions or imagination.
